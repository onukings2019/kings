Hi, Iâ€™m Kingsley from Abuja Nigeria, a data analyst . I recently analyzed The Ford GoBike System Data, the dataset includes information about individuals ride in a bike-sharing system covering the the great San Francisco Bay Area.  This data analysis provide answers to questions of 
When are most trips taken in terms of time of day, day of the week, or month of the year? 
How long does the average trip take?
Does the above depend on if a user is a subscriber or customer?
My passion for data analysis my desire will help me in providing insight from data for individuals and organizations and I am looking forward to contributiong to both private and public projects in data analysis.
